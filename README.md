# Professional Case Studies and Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my professional case studies and projects, highlighting my experience in customer support management, AI strategy, and web development.

## About
This repository is a collection of case studies documenting real-world challenges and solutions I've worked on in various industries. These case studies focus on:
- Strategic analysis for AI implementations in customer support
- Cost-benefit evaluations and process optimizations
- Long-term planning and scalability in tech and operations

In addition, I use this repository to practice and develop my web development skills by incorporating GitHub Pages and other tools to enhance the presentation of my work.

## Case Studies
Each case study is a deep dive into a specific professional challenge, detailing the problem, solution approach, and outcomes. You can view individual case studies by navigating to the relevant files or folders:

1. **[AI Agent Renewal Strategy](path/to/AI_Agent_Renewal_Case_Study.md)** - Balancing cost efficiency and customer satisfaction in support automation.
2. **[Other Case Study Title](path/to/Other_Case_Study.md)** - Brief description.

## Projects and Web Development Practice
Alongside case studies, I also document my web development practice:
- **HTML/CSS and JavaScript Projects**
- **Responsive Web Design**
- **GitHub Pages customization with Jekyll**

## How to Use This Repository
You can navigate through the folders to explore individual case studies or view my web development projects. I frequently update this repository as I complete new projects and case studies.

## Future Goals
I plan to:
- Expand my portfolio with more in-depth case studies
- Integrate more advanced web development practices
- Continue refining my presentation and documentation skills
