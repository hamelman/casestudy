# Professional Case Studies and Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my professional case studies and projects, highlighting my experience in customer support management, AI strategy, and web development.

## About
This repository is a collection of case studies documenting real-world challenges and solutions I've worked on in various industries. These case studies focus on:
- Strategic analysis for AI implementations in customer support, their cost-benefit evaluations and process optimizations
- Developing customer support centers that adapt to and leverage rapidly advancing, technology-driven environments
- Implementing mindful coaching practices and innovative development techniques to drive impactful growth and continuous improvement

In addition, I use this repository to practice and develop my web development skills by incorporating GitHub Pages and other tools to enhance the presentation of my work.

## Case Studies
Each case study is a deep dive into a specific professional challenge, detailing the problem, solution approach, and outcomes. You can view individual case studies by navigating to the relevant files or folders:

1. **[Making AI Agents Work in Modern Support](path/to/AI_Agent_Renewal_Case_Study.md)** - Balancing cost efficiency and customer satisfaction in support automation.
2. **[Building a Staffing Plan for a Live Contact Center](path/to/Other_Case_Study.md)** - Tasked with building a 24/7 staffing plan that meets organizational SLAs including a minimum of 200 outgoing vendor follow-ups per day.
3. **[Concentious Coaching](path/to/Concentious_Coaching_Case_Study.md)** - Comparing and contrasting strategies for development and performance management of team memebrs with different challenges and needs.

## Projects and Web Development Practice
Alongside case studies, I also document my web development practice:
- **HTML/CSS and JavaScript Projects**
- **Responsive Web Design**
- **GitHub Pages customization with Jekyll**

## How to Use This Repository
You can navigate through the folders to explore individual case studies and eventually view my web development projects. I frequently update this repository as I complete new projects and case studies.

## Future Goals
I plan to:
- Expand my portfolio with more in-depth case studies
- Integrate more advanced web development practices
- Continue refining my presentation and documentation skills
